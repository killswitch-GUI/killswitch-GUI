### âš¡ Offensive Security Research & Tools
Over the years I have worked on various projects ranging from small research projects to team based projects in support of OSS. The following work spans over 10 years of OSS development, training, and research. Most of the code is research for other operational projects for red teaming, pentesting and IR.

##### Agents

* [DeepFreeze-Agent](https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/DeepFreeze-Agent) - Custom C++ agent to learn various Windows C APIs and WMI process, service, driver monitoring supporting dynamic rule creation. See confrence talk https://www.slideshare.net/AlexanderRymdekoHarv/rat-repurposing-adversarial-tradecraft
* [EmPyre](https://github.com/EmpireProject/EmPyre) - Core contributor on a team to develop EmPyre, a pure Python post-exploitation agent for OSX that was used on various Red Team engagements as limited OSS agents existed.
* [Empire](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire) - Core contributor on a team to support and develop on Empire after the python agent was merged into the Empire branch for cross platform operations.


##### Infrastructure

* [Rapid Attack Infrastructure (RAI)](https://github.com/obscuritylabs/RAI) - Team project to automate C2 redirector setup for Red Team OP's

* [CobaltStrike-ToolKit](https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/CobaltStrike-ToolKit) - Various collection of tools and scripts built over the years for CS


##### Host Collection & Modules

* [SetWindowsHookEx-Keylogger](https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/SetWindowsHookEx-Keylogger) - Example implementation of a Windows C++ Native Keylogger using SetWindowsHookEx
* [HastySeries](https://github.com/obscuritylabs/HastySeries) - C# toolset for offensive operators to triage, asses and make intelligent able decisions. 
* [minidump-lib](https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/minidump-lib) - C++ MiniDumpWriteDump static lib example, with CLI
* [Invoke-EncryptedZip.ps1](https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/PenTesting-Scripts/blob/master/Invoke-EncryptedZip.ps1) - Utility to make a encrypted and compressed Zip file from a provided folder. This allows users to stage files in a designated folder for exfil, or protection from final storage location.

Returns x86 or x64. It is based off research into remote service kernel exploitation and loaders.


##### Sniffers

* [Winsock-PCAP](https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/Winsock-PCAP) - Demonstrates a POC of how an older, yet still safe, method of native PCAP can take place using the Winsock2 library on Windows. This uses a reflective DLL injection to deploy and name pipes using a PowerShell POC communicator.
* [NIX-Sniffer-Examples](https://github.com/killswitch-GUI/NIX-Sniffer-Examples) - Linux Python 2.7 Socket sniffer (Layer 3 and up), OSX Libpcap monitor mode test and sniffer research
